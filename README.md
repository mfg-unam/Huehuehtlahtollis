# Huehuetlahtollis

The corpus of text documents presented here includes two assemblies of transcripts of Nahua speeches that were orally transmitted across generations before the Spanish Conquest (Huehuetlahtollis), which were written and compiled in the XVI century. 

Each collection of texts is in a different directory. The first one corresponds to 77 discourses assembled by Fray Diego de Durán [1]; the second is the compilation gathered by Fernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc and includes 138 texts [3]. 

The file's title indicates the collection to which it belongs and has a consecutive index assigned to distinguish it. A long title accompanies each speech, with a description of its content attributed to the person who initially made the written transcript of the speech from the oral tradition record.

Each speech has been arranged in a separate document. The initial line of the document indicates the (long) title of the speech, which starts from the second line.

An additional text document in each collection's folder will indicate the label assigned to each discourse by a linguistic expert (_labels_collection.txt_). 

The label groups were established with three progressive criteria: lexicon, semantic fields -including noun phrases- confronted with the philological categorization proposed in [3], and referential information. Additionally, informative and lexical reiteration was also explicitly used to disambiguate particular cases to establish the definitive labeling. Some proper names were excluded during manual tagging. Following the described criteria, each document in the corpora was manually labeled in one of five distinct categories: prayers, governance, succession, war, and lamentations. 

The tagging is provided in the form of a list, where the label assigned in each line corresponds to each numbered file. In the case of Duran's collection, the texts are numbered from 0 to 76, and the class assignment corresponds to the following numbering: (1) governance, (2) prayers, (3) war, (4) lamentations, and (5) succession. In the case of the Tezozomoc's collection, the documents are numbered from 0 to 137, and the class assignment corresponds to the following numbering: (1) lamentations, (2) succession, (3) prayers, (4) war, and (5) governance.
